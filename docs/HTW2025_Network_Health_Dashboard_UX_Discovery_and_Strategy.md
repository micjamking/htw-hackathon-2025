# Honolulu Tech Weeks 2025 “Network Health Dashboard” – UX Discovery & Strategy

## Summary

This document outlines the discovery findings and strategy for the **Honolulu Tech Week 2025 Network Health Dashboard**. The goal of this dashboard is to visualize HTW’s reach and impact in order to attract future sponsors and engage the community. The insights and recommendations here are based on analysis of the provided audience data, inspiration from cutting-edge 3D data visualizations, and alignment with HTW’s business goals and brand guidelines. Key activities in this discovery included:

* **Data Analysis:** Reviewing the HTW 2025 audience dataset (≈2,600 participants) to understand user demographics, industries, and geographic distribution.

* **Competitive Inspiration:** Researching interactive visualization examples (e.g. 3D globe and island UIs) to draw lessons on engagement and clarity.

* **Stakeholder Goals Review:** Focusing on HTW’s mission and sponsorship objectives to ensure the dashboard supports outreach and funding needs.

* **Design Alignment:** Ensuring concepts adhere to the HTW Design System guidelines for branding, accessibility, and consistency.

By synthesizing these findings, we present a strategy for a **desktop-first, mobile-responsive** dashboard experience that showcases HTW 2025’s impact (3,000+ participants across 50+ events[\[1\]](https://honolulutechweek.com/#:~:text=Honolulu%20Tech%20Week%20is%20a,workers%2C%20content%20creators%2C%20and%20more)) in a compelling, interactive format.

## Goals

* **Primary Goal – Showcase Impact to Attract Sponsors:** The dashboard must clearly communicate HTW’s reach (e.g. number of attendees, events, industries, global spread) in order to **demonstrate value to potential sponsors**. By visualizing how HTW unites over 3,000 people in 50+ events[\[1\]](https://honolulutechweek.com/#:~:text=Honolulu%20Tech%20Week%20is%20a,workers%2C%20content%20creators%2C%20and%20more), sponsors should immediately grasp the **scale and influence** of the tech week.

* **Secondary Goal – Engage and Inform the Community:** Provide an interactive and insightful experience for event participants and the general public. The dashboard should **celebrate the network** (participants, locations, industries) so users feel proud and involved, reinforcing HTW’s role in the tech ecosystem.

* **User Experience Goal – Clarity and Wow-Factor:** Deliver key data in an **intuitive, digestible way** while also using creative 3D visuals to **captivate users**. The interface should balance a **cutting-edge tech aesthetic** (to reflect innovation) with **clear information design** so that insights are memorable and actionable.

These goals ensure the dashboard not only **meets business objectives** (sponsorship appeal) but also provides **value to users**, aligning with HTW’s mission to grow Hawaii’s tech community.

## Audience Profiles

The target audiences for the Network Health Dashboard span several stakeholder groups, each with distinct needs and priorities:

* **Prospective Sponsors:** *Example:* A marketing director at a tech company or a venture fund associate. Sponsors want quick proof of HTW’s impact and ROI potential. They care about **high-level metrics** (attendance numbers, audience demographics, industry representation) and will look for credibility and professionalism. This persona is busy and will appreciate an at-a-glance **summary of reach**, perhaps verifying that HTW attracts a broad, engaged audience (e.g. “3000+ attendees from 20+ countries”). They need confidence that sponsoring HTW means **exposure to a large, relevant audience**.

* **Event Participants:** *Example:* A local startup founder or a student developer who attended HTW 2025\. Participants are curious to see the **bigger picture of the community** they are part of. They might explore the map to find how many people attended, from which cities or industries, and feel a sense of pride in the **network’s diversity and scale**. Their goal is to **celebrate the community** and possibly find connections (e.g. noticing many attendees from their industry or new regions represented). They need an engaging, fun way to view data rather than dry statistics.

* **General Public & Community Leaders:** *Example:* A Honolulu resident or a government official interested in tech ecosystem growth. They may not have attended HTW, but they’re interested in **Hawaii’s tech landscape**. This audience wants to see **evidence of momentum**: how HTW is connecting people, the variety of industries involved, and the geographic reach (showing Hawaii as a hub that draws global interest). They will use the dashboard as a **storytelling tool** to understand and possibly promote the idea that “Tech meets Hawaii” on a global stage. Clarity and accessible design (including on mobile) are key for this broad audience.

By addressing the needs of these profiles, the dashboard will ensure that **sponsors get convincing data**, participants get an **interactive community snapshot**, and the public gets a **clear narrative of HTW’s impact**.

## Creative Direction

The creative direction merges **HTW’s brand identity** with innovative data visualization, resulting in a dashboard that feels both on-brand and forward-thinking. Key principles include:

* **Brand Alignment:** All design elements will follow the **HTW Design System** (HTW\_DESIGN\_SYSTEM\_GUIDE), ensuring consistency with the event’s branding. This means using HTW’s approved color palette – likely a mix of **vibrant, tech-forward colors** with touches of Hawaii’s landscape (for example, oceanic blues, tropical greens, sunset oranges) – and official typography for a professional look. The dashboard should immediately be recognizable as part of the HTW family, reinforcing trust and credibility.

* **Technology Meets Hawaii Aesthetic:** Visually, the interface should reflect the theme “Where Tech Meets Hawaii.” We will blend a **modern, high-tech UI** (clean lines, dynamic graphics, 3D elements) with **subtle Hawaiian motifs**. For instance, an abstract 3D island or archipelago can serve as a centerpiece background, evoking Hawaii, while a rotating digital globe conveys global reach. The tone is **innovative and optimistic** – showcasing cutting-edge tech visuals while incorporating the aloha spirit (warm, welcoming design touches).

* **Engaging yet Clear:** Striking the right balance between creativity and clarity is crucial. The design will leverage interactive 3D visuals (to impress and engage sponsors and users), but without clutter or confusion. We will use **ample spacing, clear hierarchy, and intuitive icons** so that even with rich graphics, the data points (counts, labels, legends) are easily readable. High contrast colors will distinguish interactive elements from background. For example, glowing pins or markers on the 3D map can stand out against a dark ocean background, and important numbers will be in large, bold type. The overall vibe should be **cutting-edge** but **approachable** – exciting to explore, yet not intimidating.

* **Responsive & Accessible Design:** The layout is conceived as **desktop-first** (to accommodate complex 3D visuals and rich interactions) but will gracefully adapt to mobile. On desktop, users might see an expansive globe or 3D scene, whereas on mobile the experience may simplify (e.g. a static or 2D map image with summary stats) to ensure performance and usability on small screens. Throughout the design, we’ll follow accessibility best practices: readable font sizes, color choices that meet contrast standards, and alternative text or data views for those who cannot interact with a 3D scene. This inclusivity aligns with HTW’s community-focused values.

In summary, the creative direction aims for a **modern, immersive data experience** that still feels consistent with HTW’s brand and mission. The dashboard should **excite viewers with its 3D interactive elements** while maintaining a **polished, professional presentation** befitting a platform intended to win over sponsors.

## Competitive Inspiration

To ground our strategy, we reviewed analogous products and inspirational interfaces that tackle similar challenges of visualizing complex data in engaging ways. Two standout references influenced our approach:

**1\. SurveillanceWatch.io (Interactive Globe Visualization)** – *An award-winning data-viz project by Humaan*: This site presents an interactive 3D globe highlighting connections in the global surveillance industry. It **reveals intricate networks on a rotating Earth**[\[2\]](https://www.humaan.com/work/surveillance-watch#:~:text=Surveillance%20Watch%20is%20an%20interactive,their%20funding%20sources%20and%20affiliations), which proved highly engaging to users. **What we liked:**  
\- **Immersive 3D Globe UI:** The use of a spinning globe immediately grabs attention and encourages exploration. Users can orbit the world, zoom into regions, and see data points connected by arcs, conveying a sense of global scale. This aligns with our need to show HTW’s worldwide reach in a visceral way (e.g., pins on a globe for each participant’s location).  
\- **Clear Narrative & Engagement:** Despite handling complex data, the platform is designed to be *logical and easy to navigate*, inviting users to explore while keeping insights clear[\[3\]](https://www.humaan.com/work/surveillance-watch#:~:text=The%20platform%20was%20designed%20to,with%20the%20site%E2%80%99s%20headless%20architecture). This balance is crucial for our dashboard – we want an **engaging experience that remains informative**. Surveillance Watch demonstrates how thoughtful UI cues (like legends, filters, or highlights) can guide users through data without overwhelming them.  
\- **Lessons for HTW:** We aim to emulate the **wow-factor** of the globe visualization to showcase HTW’s global connections. At the same time, we note potential challenges: such a heavy visual experience must be optimized for performance (Surveillance Watch’s globe, for example, might not load on older browsers without tweaks). We’ll ensure that our implementation in Three.js is efficient and offer fallbacks if needed (so that, for instance, a user on an older device still sees a summary map).

**2\. WelcomeToBerk.com (3D Island Experience)** – *Official interactive site for “How to Train Your Dragon”*: This site allows users to explore the fantasy Island of Berk in 3D, which is a compelling analogy for representing a geographic area (in our case, Hawaii). **What we drew from it:**  
\- **3D Island Visualization:** The site creates a miniature 3D world (with terrain, buildings, etc.) that users can navigate. For HTW, this inspires us to incorporate a **stylized 3D island or map of Hawaii** as part of the dashboard. An island model evocative of Hawaii could serve as a memorable centerpiece, grounding the tech data in a sense of place. It visually reinforces HTW’s unique location and culture.  
\- **Delightful Interaction:** The *Welcome to Berk* site is engaging and game-like – users can click on points of interest, which adds an element of discovery. For our purposes, we see an opportunity to make exploring HTW’s data **fun and narrative-driven**. For example, hovering over the Hawaii island model could highlight different venue locations across O‘ahu, or perhaps show how local events cluster in the city. This adds **contextual storytelling**: not only do we have a globe for global reach, but an island view to emphasize the local hub.  
\- **Considerations:** The Berk example is essentially an entertainment-centric design, so we must ensure our adaptation doesn’t detract from data clarity. We’ll borrow the *spirit* of an interactive island but keep the focus on information (e.g., using the island mainly as an interactive map rather than a purely decorative 3D scene). Additionally, such graphics can be resource-intensive; we plan to simplify the 3D models and limit detail to maintain smooth performance on web.

**Other Inspirations:** We also noted general patterns from modern dashboards and event infographics – for instance, simple **interactive maps (like Google’s visualization tools)** for clusters and **animated counters** for key metrics – to ensure our design isn’t just flashy but also follows UX best practices. Reviewing these inspirations confirmed that an effective solution should **engage users visually, tell a story with data, and remain easy to use**.

By analyzing what works in these references, our strategy cherry-picks the best ideas (a **globe for global scale**, an **island for local flair**, **interactive storytelling**) while being mindful of their pitfalls (performance, potential complexity). This gives us confidence in crafting a dashboard that is **both imaginative and effective**.

## Information Architecture

Although the Network Health Dashboard will likely be a single-page web application, it’s important to structure the content and interactions logically. Below is the high-level information architecture and content flow we envision:

1. **Dashboard Overview (Landing Section):** When users first arrive, they see a **summary at a glance**. This top section features the HTW branding and a brief intro (one-liner like “See how Honolulu Tech Week connects 3,000+ people across the globe”). Key metrics are immediately visible as large, bold figures – for example:

2. **Total Participants:** X,XXX (with a caption “Registered Attendees in 2025”)

3. **Events:** 50+ events

4. **Industries:** e.g. 12 industries represented

5. **Locations:** number of countries or states (e.g. “Participants from 20+ countries, 40+ US states”).  
   These numbers give sponsors a quick digest of impact. The design might use **icons or infographics** next to each metric (e.g., a person icon for participants, a map pin for locations) for visual reinforcement.

6. **Global Map Visualization:** Dominating the page will be the **interactive 3D Globe** (via Three.js). This element is the core of the experience: a rotatable Earth with glowing pins or markers indicating participant locations worldwide. Key aspects:

7. **Cluster Highlights:** Since the majority of attendees are from the U.S. (especially Hawaii) with others scattered globally, the map will group close points into clusters. For example, a huge cluster over Hawaii (2000+ people in HI) versus smaller clusters in California, East Coast, Asia-Pacific, etc. The globe can show **heat-map intensity** or pin clusters – perhaps larger or brighter markers where there are more people.

8. **Interactive Zoom & Pan:** Users (especially sponsors wanting detail) can click and drag to rotate the globe, zoom in on regions, and tap on clusters. When a cluster or marker is clicked, a **tooltip or side panel** appears showing details for that region: e.g., “Hawaii: 2005 participants” or “California: 105 participants”. If multiple countries, clicking a continent could summarize by country. This allows exploration of **where HTW attendees come from**.

9. **Animated Transitions:** For polish, the globe might have subtle animations (slow rotation on idle, or animated arcs connecting distant locations to Hawaii, symbolizing how people traveled or connected to the event). These animations should be gentle and not distract from usability.

10. **Local (Hawaii) Focus View:** Recognizing that Honolulu is the event epicenter, we plan a way to highlight local impact. This could be a **toggle or automatic drill-down**: for example, if a user clicks Hawaii on the globe (or a dedicated button), the view transitions to a **zoomed 3D map of O‘ahu (or the Hawaiian Islands)**. In this view:

11. Major HTW **venue locations** could be pinpointed (e.g., a pin for each of the 20+ venues across Honolulu[\[4\]](https://honolulutechweek.com/#:~:text=Events%20are%20held%20across%2020%2B,coffees%2C%20mixers%2C%20and%20product%20launches)). This shows sponsors the breadth of local engagement (campuses, coworking spaces, etc., indicating community penetration).

12. Alternatively or additionally, this view can aggregate local data: e.g., breakdown of Hawaii attendees by island or by city/neighborhood if relevant.

13. The island visualization would use the same style as the globe for consistency (e.g., similar marker design) but zoomed in for detail. Users can rotate the 3D island model or it might be a fixed angle with interactive hotspots, depending on complexity.

14. A “Back to Globe” option would return the user to the world view.

15. **Industry & Demographic Insights:** Below or alongside the map, the dashboard will present **additional data panels** to showcase the diversity of HTW’s audience:

16. **Industries Represented:** A visualization (bar chart or donut chart) showing the top industries of participants. For example, bars for “Software & Technology (X%)”, “Education/EdTech (Y%)”, “Consulting”, “Healthcare”, etc. According to the data, HTW 2025 drew participants from a wide range of sectors (e.g. tech, government, finance, academia). This chart highlights that **HTW isn’t limited to one niche** – a selling point for sponsors from any industry.

17. **Attendee Roles/Types:** If data allows, we might show a breakdown by role (e.g., entrepreneurs, investors, students, executives) or affiliation (local vs. out-of-state attendees). This could be a simple statistic or infographic (e.g., “60% local Hawaii residents, 40% from outside”). It gives context on the audience makeup.

18. These panels will be interactive where possible. For instance, clicking an industry in the chart could highlight those attendees on the map (if we have geodata per industry) or show a short description of HTW’s appeal in that sector. But even static, they add important depth beyond raw location counts.

19. **Key Highlights / Stories (Optional):** To further humanize the data, a section could feature one or two short “highlight stories” or facts. For example: “📈 *Growth:* HTW attendance grew 25% from last year” or “🌐 *Global Reach:* Participants joined from 23 countries across 5 continents”. These bite-sized callouts, possibly with small icons or images, help frame the numbers in a narrative that sponsors can easily remember (e.g., “HTW is growing fast” or “truly international attendance”). *(If historical data is not available, this section could instead highlight a testimonial or a quote about HTW’s impact.)*

20. **Call to Action for Sponsors:** Since a main goal is attracting sponsorship, the information architecture should conclude with a clear **next step**. At the bottom of the dashboard (or fixed in a corner) there will be a prompt like **“Interested in Partnering with HTW?**” with a brief blurb and a button to contact the organizers or download a sponsorship prospectus. After we’ve impressed them with data, we make it easy to act on that interest.

21. **Navigation & Structure:** The dashboard can largely function as a scroll-down page where each of the above sections appears in sequence (Overview \-\> Globe \-\> Industry charts \-\> etc.). We will include a simple **navigation bar** or sticky menu for convenience, especially on desktop: for example, tabs or links for “Overview, Map, Insights, Sponsors”. This allows users to jump to sections. On mobile, a collapsible menu or simply a well-organized scroll will suffice. Given the focus on interactivity, most navigation is within the page (e.g., toggling the map view). There are no complex multi-page flows – simplicity is key.

In summary, the information architecture is straightforward: a single-page, data-rich dashboard with **progressive disclosure** of information – high-level stats up front, deeper drill-downs available via the interactive map and charts. This ensures all user types can get what they need: a sponsor might only glance at the top numbers and map for a minute, whereas a curious participant could spend longer exploring the globe or charts. The structure supports both quick insight and deep exploration.

## Feature Concepts

With the architecture in mind, the following are the core feature concepts proposed for the Network Health Dashboard:

* **Interactive 3D Globe Map:** *The centerpiece feature.* A Three.js-rendered Earth that users can rotate and zoom. All participant locations are plotted as interactive points. Hovering on a point shows a tooltip (e.g., city, country and attendee count), while clicking might lock the view and bring up a detailed label or side info. The globe conveys HTW’s **global reach at a glance** – for example, a sponsor can literally see pins populating not just Hawaii, but mainland US, Asia, etc., underlining that HTW draws interest worldwide. *(Technical note: clustering and possibly limiting to one pin per city will be used to keep the visualization clear and performant.)*

* **3D Hawaiian Island Visualization:** A special interactive model of O‘ahu or the Hawaiian Islands that highlights local event data. This feature may activate when zooming into Hawaii on the globe or via a separate toggle. It adds a **unique, branded touch** – essentially a mini replica of the event’s geographic heart. Users can see markers for each event venue (e.g., Honolulu Convention Center, University campus, coworking hubs), which upon hover could display the venue name and perhaps the number of attendees at events there. This feature emphasizes how **HTW is deeply rooted in the local community** even as it connects globally. (It’s also a delightful nod to Hawaii’s geography that can make the experience memorable.)

* **Key Metrics Dashboard (Counters & Icons):** Prominently displayed statistics with large numbers and icons, as described in the overview. These will likely be presented in a horizontal strip or grid at the top for easy scanning. Each metric might animate (count up) on page load for a dynamic effect. The metrics give an **instant credibility check** – for example, seeing “2500+ Attendees” reassures sponsors of event size, and “20 Countries” implies diversity. These counters stay visible (perhaps via a sticky header summary) as users interact with the map, to continuously reinforce the big numbers.

* **Industry Breakdown Chart:** A visual chart component showing the distribution of participants across industries. For instance, a bar chart might list industries on the y-axis (Technology, Finance, Education, Government, etc.) with bars indicating count of participants. Alternatively, a donut or pie chart could show percentage share of major industry categories. Users can interact by hovering to see exact figures. This feature demonstrates **the breadth of sectors engaged by HTW** – important for sponsors who might be interested in a specific field to see that their sector is well-represented. It also underscores HTW’s multidisciplinary appeal (e.g., not just tech-for-tech’s-sake, but involvement from healthcare, government, non-profits, etc.). We will ensure this chart is color-coded to match the design system and that each segment is clearly labeled for readability.

* **Location Filters & Region Highlights:** To enhance exploration, the dashboard can include simple filters or controls. One idea is a **region filter** (buttons or a dropdown) allowing users to highlight a particular region’s data. For example, selecting “North America” could zoom the globe to North America and highlight only those points, or selecting “APAC” shows Asia-Pacific participants. Another filter could toggle between viewing **countries vs. states** on the map (since for the U.S. we might want to see state-level granularity). These controls help users answer specific questions (“How many came from the mainland vs Hawaii?”) easily. For simplicity, filters would likely be limited to broad categories so as not to clutter the UI.

* **Dynamic Tooltip/Info Panel:** As users interact with the globe or charts, a **dynamic information panel** will show relevant details. For example, when the user clicks a cluster on the map, a side panel might slide in with data for that region: number of participants, top industries in that region, maybe a fun fact (e.g., “Participants from California include 10 startup founders and 5 investors”). This contextual info turns raw data points into more meaningful insights. The panel would use a clean layout with maybe a small flag icon or map icon to represent the region, and a list of stats. It’s essentially a drill-down feature accessible on demand.

* **Responsive & Adaptive Features:** On mobile devices, certain features will adjust:

* The 3D globe may simplify to a static image or a 2D map due to performance constraints. Alternatively, a smaller, touch-optimized globe can be used with limited interactivity (e.g., tap to cycle through regions rather than free rotation).

* The layout will collapse the metrics into a single column and stack the charts for vertical scrolling.

* Touch-friendly UI elements (larger tap targets for pins, swipe gestures to rotate the globe, etc.) will ensure mobile users can still engage. Given the audience includes on-the-go executives, a **polished mobile experience** is important (even if not as feature-rich as desktop).

* **Sponsor Highlight and Call-to-Action:** As a feature, the bottom section of the dashboard will serve as a conversion point. We will showcase current **HTW sponsors’ logos** (to acknowledge them and also indicate to potential sponsors which peers are involved – a bit of social proof). Then, prominently, a CTA button like “Become a Sponsor” or “Partner with Us” leads to further details. This feature ensures the dashboard not only informs but also drives the desired action. It effectively turns the data visualization into a marketing tool by providing a pathway for interested parties to reach out.

* **Technical Notes:** The dashboard will be built with a combination of **Three.js** (for 3D rendering) and standard web tech (HTML/CSS/JS, possibly using a framework like React for the interface). We will leverage WebGL capabilities for the heavy visuals, and ensure to optimize (e.g., using low-polygon models, efficient data structures for points) so that even with thousands of data points, interactions remain smooth. We’ll also implement graceful fallbacks: if WebGL is not supported, the user might see a flat world map image with pins and a note encouraging a modern browser for full experience. This way, we don’t completely lose functionality for edge cases.

Each of these features is designed to work in concert to tell a cohesive story: **HTW 2025 connected a large, diverse group of people, spanning industries and geography, anchored in Hawaii’s tech scene, and here’s the proof in an interactive format.** The features provide multiple angles on that story (numerical, geographical, categorical) ensuring that users can explore what interests them most.

## Recommendations

To successfully implement this Network Health Dashboard and meet the objectives, we offer the following recommendations and considerations:

* **Focus on Storytelling with Data:** Don’t just display numbers—contextualize them. For example, highlight that *“HTW 2025 drew participants from 23 countries, illustrating a truly global reach for a Hawaii-based event.”* Framing the data in such narratives will resonate with sponsors, turning raw stats into a compelling story of **growth and influence**. We should use section headers or annotations that drive these points home (e.g., a tagline above the globe could read “From Honolulu to the World” to reinforce the message).

* **Ensure Visual Clarity and Hierarchy:** With rich visuals in play, maintaining clarity is paramount. We recommend frequent usability checks to ensure the data is easy to interpret. Key info (like total counts or region names) should always be clearly labeled and not hidden behind interactions. Use visual hierarchy (size, color, placement) to guide the eye: e.g., the most important figures should be the most prominent. If testers ever seem confused about what a visualization means, refine the design (add a legend, simplify the graphic, etc.). Remember, sponsors might only spare a minute or two on this page—**they must grasp the impact almost instantly**.

* **Leverage HTW’s Branding for Credibility:** Align every element (colors, typography, tone of copy) with the official HTW brand guidelines. This consistency will make the dashboard feel like an authoritative extension of HTW’s communications. Use the **HTW logo** and event graphics appropriately (perhaps as a watermark on the globe or in the header) to reinforce branding. A consistent design not only looks professional but also builds trust – sponsors will feel the organization behind the event is buttoned-up and serious. Additionally, incorporate a bit of Hawaii’s visual identity (like a subtle background pattern inspired by Hawaiian art or a faint silhouette of Diamond Head) in a way that doesn’t detract from data. This gives the dashboard a unique character and memorability.

* **Test Performance Early and Often:** The 3D and interactive components are the most technically risky parts. It’s critical to test the globe and island scenes on various devices and browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, including on a typical smartphone) early in development. Optimize assets (compress textures, limit frame rates if needed) to avoid a laggy experience. Nothing will turn off a potential sponsor more than a page that crashes their browser or feels unresponsive. If necessary, implement a device detection to serve a simplified experience to low-power devices. As noted from similar projects, an immersive visualization can drive engagement **only if it runs smoothly**[\[5\]](https://www.humaan.com/work/surveillance-watch#:~:text=The%20result%20is%20an%20immersive,surveillance%20activity%20across%20many%20countries) – otherwise users will bounce.

* **Responsive Design and Mobile Considerations:** We should treat mobile not as an afterthought but design for it in parallel. The recommendation is to create wireframes for how the dashboard reflows on small screens. Possibly adopt a “mobile card” approach: each stat or chart becomes a swipeable card. The globe might turn into an interactive flat map on mobile (using canvas or SVG for lighter rendering). By planning these now, we avoid a scenario where the 3D features are unusable on mobile. Given that some busy executives (sponsors) might check the site from a phone or tablet, **the critical information (key metrics, high-level reach) must be easily accessible on mobile**. Even if the full 3D is absent, ensure they see something like a static world map image with pins and the summary stats.

* **Incorporate User Feedback and Iterate:** If time allows (even within the hackathon context, quick feedback can be gathered from peers or mentors), do a brief **user testing** of the dashboard prototype. Observing a new user (or a stand-in for a sponsor) interact for a few minutes can reveal pain points: Are they finding what they want? Do they understand the visualization? Any confusion about the controls? Use this feedback to iterate on the design – perhaps adding an onboarding tooltip that says “Drag to rotate the globe” or simplifying the interface if users seem lost. Post-hackathon, as the dashboard might go live to the public, continuing to refine with real-world feedback will further improve its effectiveness.

* **Security and Data Privacy:** Since we’re visualizing participant data (even if aggregated), ensure that no sensitive personal information is exposed. We’re only using high-level aggregates (counts by industry, by region), which is fine. But double-check that any interactive element doesn’t inadvertently leak something (for instance, if only 1 person from a small country attended, and we show their job title on hover, that could be identifying – best to avoid individual-level details). The recommendation is to **stick to anonymized, aggregated data**, which appears to be the plan. This keeps the focus on overall impact and avoids any privacy concerns.

* **Future-Proof the Design:** HTW will likely continue annually, so consider how this dashboard can be updated for 2026 and beyond. We recommend building the data visualization in a way that new data can be plugged in (perhaps the data could be read from a CSV or Google Sheet that organizers update). The design should accommodate growth – e.g., if next year it’s 5,000 people and 80 events, ensure the layout or code can handle those larger numbers without breaking. A forward-looking approach makes the dashboard a long-term asset, not just a one-off demo.

* **Promotion and Integration:** Finally, once built, integrate the dashboard into HTW’s outreach strategy. We suggest embedding it on the official Honolulu Tech Week website (perhaps under a “Impact” or “Community” section) and using it in sponsorship pitch decks. The visual nature of the dashboard makes it a great PR tool – maybe even share a snippet (like a GIF of the spinning globe with data) on social media to drum up excitement. The recommendation is to coordinate with HTW’s marketing team so the dashboard complements other content (for example, aligning its launch with a post-event report or sponsor solicitation campaign).

By following these recommendations, we will create a **high-impact Network Health Dashboard** that not only meets the hackathon challenge requirements but also delivers real value to Honolulu Tech Week. It will effectively **showcase the event’s success** in a modern, engaging way, helping to attract future sponsors and solidify HTW’s reputation as a growing, connected tech community. As seen with similar interactive projects, a well-executed dashboard can dramatically boost engagement and awareness[\[5\]](https://www.humaan.com/work/surveillance-watch#:~:text=The%20result%20is%20an%20immersive,surveillance%20activity%20across%20many%20countries) – we anticipate the same outcome for HTW, turning data into an asset for community growth and funding.
