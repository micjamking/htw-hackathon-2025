HACKATHON CHALLENGES


* Earn / Task list for HTW
Create an Earn / Task list for HTW, where the HTW team can post projects for bounty e.g. create an AI promo video for HTW, submit a bug on the HTW site. People can then submit their tasks to this and then get paid. The best example of this is https://ns.com/earn

Job Listing Board for HTW
Build a job board for the HTW community, where local companies can submit roles that link to their primary job listings. The key piece of this should include the ability for us to set a price for the job listings, so companies can pay $X amount to have a job posted, HTW approves it first, and then it's listed. Use https://remoteok.com/ for inspiration.

New HTW Website
Design a new HTW website using the media resources. Think creatively, the website should embody the spirit of HTW mixing tech, people, and Hawaii. It should include a lander, partners, creators, about, and other pages you see relevant.

* Event Host Planning & Onboarding
Build out a page / chatbot / or other tool to streamline the event host planning and onboarding. Currently this is the BIGGEST pain point of HTW - getting community event hosts to plan and execute great events. This can include both the planning and marketing documents, and should provide a way for us to approve and provide feedback on events.

* HTW BI / Network Health Dashboard
Develop a network health dashboard for HTW that includes the number of people, number of events, data visualization by industry, location e.g. map of where everyone is from, etc.

HTW General / Wildcard
Bring any HTW-impactful idea to life. Open category for creative projects that advance the community—tools, content, integrations, or experiments that align with HTW’s mission.

Growth Marketing Tool
Build a creative growth marketing tool that helps individuals or event hosts better market HTW. Think in terms of marketing campaign, virality, and creative ideas. E.g. what would the HTW Studio Ghibli moment look like.
